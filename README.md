# ME 701 - Homework 5

This homework consists of two exercises that build on the recitation examples
(i.e., the cards and decks example and the vector example).

## Problem 1

I've given you the `Card`, `Hand`, and `Deck` classes.  You need to
finish implementing `Hand.whatami` in `poker.py` so that it returns which type of
poker hand you have.  See [this article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_poker_hands)
for more.  Also, complete the set of unit tests in `test_poker.py`.


## Problem 2

For this problem, add a dot product function to the `Vector` class, add a test
for that function, and fix up any of the tests (or issues) that remain with
the existing tests.
