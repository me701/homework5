# ME 701 - Homework 5

## Problem 1

For this problem, add a dot product function to the `Vector` class, add a test
for that function, and fix up any of the tests (or issues) that remain with
the existing tests.

Then, make a `SparseVector` class that inherits from `Vector`.  Such a vector
should store nonzero values and their locations.  Implement any changes needed
in the methods, and add test cases equivalent to those given for `Vector`.

## Problem 2

In class we applied a procedure for identifying classes, attributes, and methods
to the game Love Letter.

For this problem, consider just a single *round*, i.e., when each player has one
turn (unless the round is won).  Design classes with attributes and methods
needed to model such a single round.  You do *not* need to write real code for this, but
Python might be a good way to write.
